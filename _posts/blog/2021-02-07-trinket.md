A little trinket stuck high up on a shelf, \
unnoticed by passerbys.\
A little trinket,  full of little gears \
forming a labryinthÂ 

    [ lab-uh-rinth ]
        
        noun:
            1. an intricate combination of paths or passages in which
            it is difficult to find one's way or to reach the exit.
            2. a maze of paths bordered by high hedges, as in a park or 
            garden, for the amusement of those who search for a way out.
            3. a complicated or tortuous arrangement.
            4. any confusingly intricate state of things or events; 
            a bewildering complex:

with little spines\
folding together in synchrony,\
spinning pointlessly away.

Until they don't.
